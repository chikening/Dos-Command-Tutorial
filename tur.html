            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the interactive command line tutorial. If you've never used a command line interface before, don't worry! This section will introduce you to the basics of navigating and executing commands in our CMD environment.</p>
            
            <h3>Accessing the CMD Interface</h3>
            <p>To start using the command line interface, navigate to our "Try It Out" page from the navigation menu. Once there, you'll see a simulated command line environment ready for your input.</p>
            
            <h3>Understanding the CMD Prompt</h3>
            <p>The CMD prompt typically looks something like this: <code>C:\Users\DosMaster&gt;</code>. This prompt indicates your current directory. In this case, you're in the 'DosMaster' user directory. The '>' symbol is where you'll type your commands.</p>
            
            <h3>Basic Navigation Commands</h3>
            <p>Let's go through some basic commands to get you started:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>dir</code> - Displays a list of files and directories in the current directory.</li>
                <li><code>cd [directory name]</code> - Changes the current directory to the one specified. Replace "[directory name]" with the name of the directory you want to navigate to.</li>
                <li><code>cls</code> - Clears the CMD screen of all previous commands and outputs, giving you a clean slate.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Executing Your First Command</h3>
            <p>Try executing the <code>dir</code> command in the CMD interface. This will display all the files and directories in your current location. To execute a command, type it after the prompt and press Enter.</p>
            
            <p>This is just the beginning of what you can do with the command line interface. As you become more comfortable with these basic commands, you'll find that the CMD can be a powerful tool for navigating and managing files on your computer.</p>
